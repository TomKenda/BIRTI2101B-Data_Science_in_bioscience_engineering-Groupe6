# Prediction of coding genes with Deep Learning on yeast genome

## Course BIRTI2101B - Data Science in bioscience engineering - Groupe6

### General context
This repository is about the project we have been carrying out with the "Groupe 6" during the course "BIRTI2101B - Data Science in bioscience engineering" 
at the UCLouvain during the first semster of master 1.

### The project
During this project we have been trying to implement a Deel Learning model with keras and tensorflow. 
The aim was to be abble to predict if a given gene in the S. Cerevicae's genome was a coding gene or not. 

### About this repository
In this repository you will find all the document that that we have created during this project. They are the following :
  * **Slide-show and report** : this folder includes the powerpoint we used to present the 4 different part of our project. You will find some illustration and link in it. 
      In addition you will find the  final report of our project where explain the  result and we drawn some conclusion.
